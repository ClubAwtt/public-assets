# Public Assets

NOTICE: Our layouts will change in the somewhat near future. If you are currently making something for an event, or plan to host one, please message me on discord so we can make sure I won't change things before you run your event. (@lightningdasher)

Among the files you will find our logos and screen layout, as well as everything you need to setup
custom DMX lightshows for our world.


You can use the scene file to create and test your own light setups.
Requires being familiar with QLC+, SoundSwitch or other similar software.
Make a new Unity Project, import the required packages and all the files inside the Assets folder **before** opening the scene file.
Ensure that you leave all the files within the default Assets folder, as the scene file won't have matching paths otherwise.
Utilize the dmx patchlist to configure your controller.
